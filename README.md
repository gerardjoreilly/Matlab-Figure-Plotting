# Matlab Figure Plotting

This is an example script to plot something in Matlab and then create some high quality plots to be used in documents. This means that they will look well in documents written using Times New Roman with a font size of around 11pt.

Scripts that are freely available on the web are used and provided here also. No copyright infringement is intended.

## Required Scripts
startup.m - this is a pretty fundamental script that is to be run at the beginning of your script so that it loads the variabls that will be used
in plotting. It also does a clear, close and clc sweep to clean the
workspace etc.

rgb.m - this is needed to generate the colours used in the cmap variable. You don't need to use or call it, it just needs to be findable by Matlab.

This is to be completed...
